  #inconsistency examples: 
  #player A buy an item with %player_name% holder, player B take A item, B try to sell the item but he can't because %player_name% for B it's not the same of A
  #player A buy an item with %player_name% holder, player A change name to B, try to sell the item but he can't because %player_name% now it's B and do not match old name A
